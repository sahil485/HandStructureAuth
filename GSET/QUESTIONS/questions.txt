1. The chirp refers to the signal that changes over time. Why is it beneficial to repeat
    frequencies in the chirp. Is there an advantage to high spectral coherence in
    this scenario?

2. I understand the general process of the project works but where specifically is 
    code where the microphone perceives the signal/audio?

3.  For the function, there is func_chirp and get_features but where is the in 
    between where the user-influenced chirp signal is actually received/measured? 

4. In Step 2 - Cross Correlation, what is the signal cross correlating with? Is it the 
    sample given in training data? Specifically, is it correct that this section is 
    trying to get the signal of the structure-borne signal independent of the airborne signal.

5. Can the desired signal processing also be done using Fourier transform/analysis
    of the airborne sound vs. the structure-borne sound

6. Going into the actual specifics of the sound, is the chirp a pure frequency. 
    Are there any resources you could point me to in understanding how structure-borne
    propagation would effect that pure sound. 

7. Can you explain the graph made about the 3 different positions in your research 
    paper about the topic? 

8. How exactly/what exactly are you calculating in Step 4 for calculation of variance, 
    std, etc. Is it in terms of frequency?
